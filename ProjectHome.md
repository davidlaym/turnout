# TurnOut.NET #
TurnOut.NET is a browser chooser for Windows. It acts as your default browser. When you click a link or a html file it opens up and lets you choose from 3 customizable browsers.

## Why? ##
I love to use [SWare Iron](http://www.srware.net/software_srware_iron.php) as a browser. At work I have to use the Internet Explorer or Firefox for some web applications that do not work in Chromium browsers. So I had to set my default browser to a browser I do not like.

Inspired by [tigions](http://tigion.de) mac software [choose wisely](http://blog.tigion.de/2010/02/16/software-choose-wisely) I searched the web for a similar app for Windows operating systems and I did not find any. So I decided to code one myself.

## How? ##
TurnOut.NET acts as your default browser. When you click a link or open a html file it appears and asks you which browser you want to use to open the link.
